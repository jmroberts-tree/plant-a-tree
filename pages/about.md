Celebrate With Trees is a site about planting trees! Why plant trees?

Trees are the lungs of Planet Earth.  Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the air.  We all know that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is heating up our Earth, changing the climate, and making our planet less and less able to sustain human life and other creatures.

Scientists estimate that [a trillion trees need to be planted to remove the excess carbon accumulated in our atmosphere](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions). By planting trees, each of us is contributing towards reaching that challenging total.


We believe in:
* Planting trees locally, [to improve and connect with our local surroundings](https://www.treepeople.org/tree-benefits).
* Planting indigenous trees and plants, [so they'll thrive where they are planted](https://thetyee.ca/News/2020/02/28/If-We-Plant-Trees-They-Must-Be-Native-Trees/).
* Planting fruit and nuts trees, to grow (delicious!) food close to home.
* Planting trees ourselves, because getting our hands dirty is fun.

We also think that getting other people planting trees in other parts of the world is great.  Here are some links about that:

* [Rainforest Protectors](http://www.rainforestprotectors.org/rainforest/Projects.aspx)
