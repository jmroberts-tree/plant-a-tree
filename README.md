# Plant A Tree

Plant a tree!

## TODO
- make smaller pictures, so things load faster
- do some basic SEO??!?

- new post:  "Planning" - see mom's mail for text.

- Other changes
On the home page there are some inconsistencies compared to what we have on other pages.

Please change "We believe in planting indigenous trees, locally â€“ and have assembled a collection of resources to help you do this!" to 
"We believe in planting local indigenous trees to restore ecosystems, or fruit and nut trees to improve local food security.  We've assembled a collection of resources to help you do this!"

"Read on for resources about trees in your part of the world, how the site began, and more. ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²"
I think talking about trees in your part of the world is too broad as we've ended up with BC resources for now  How about: " Read on for resources about trees, how the site began, and more. ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²

At the bottom of the Home Page there are buttons, "Next" and "Previous" that don't go anywhere.   Please remove them or add links if you have an idea for how to use them.


- About Page
I'm not sure we've explained clearly how this site came to be.  How about adding at the top of the About page;
How this Website Came to Be
The positive and generous responses of guests at Julia's 70th birthday party and at Ian and Julia's wedding was so heartening that we felt others could use the idea of planting trees instead of receiving birthday or wedding gifts.  So Julia's son, Thor, built us this website to spread the idea of trees as gifts - gifts for the people who are celebrating and gifts for the future of humans on Earth.

Then continue with the rest of the About page.  Can the text be made a bit bigger?  Please remove "(Add supporting links here.)", because we've got links on each line.  Then for LInk 1 use:  https://www.youngleadersuganda.org/fruit-tree-planting/
Link 2  http://www.rainforestprotectors.org/rainforest/Projects.aspx
Link 3  https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/large-scale-planting/
For now remove the New York State reference

- Plant More Trees Page
Can you make the text bigger?
Also, please change to   " Please also add stories of your tree planting celebrations using the same link!"
